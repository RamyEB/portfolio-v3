I love everything related to high-tech and IT. 

Since I discovered programming, I like to create things! Whether it's websites, applications, software or completely useless things.

I had the chance to finalize my [two-year university degree](https://iutv.univ-paris13.fr/dut-informatique/) in Montreal (Canada), which allowed me to better define my professional project and to discover other ways of working.

Having taken courses at the [University of Cergy-Pontoise](https://www.u-cergy.fr/fr/formations/schema-des-formations/licence-lmd-XA/sciences-technologies-sante-STS/licence-informatique-program-e29-101.html) and at [EPITA for my Master degree](https://www.epita.fr/nos-formations/titres-par-lapprentissage/cycle-expert/) has increased my lifelong passion for computers.

I see myself as a student who is very involved, passionate, curious and motivated by what he undertakes,
