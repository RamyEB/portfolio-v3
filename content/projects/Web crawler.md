Project proposed by the start-up company Alien6. The objective was to create an expert system to simplify the management of obsolescence of an information system by creating a database, a website and a crawler. 
As head of this project, I learned how to manage a team and carry out the professional project in parallel. On the other hand, it was very enriching from a technical point of view because we had to use technologies never seen before.
